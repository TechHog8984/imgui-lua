| Subsystems | Stage                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| Fonts(ttf) | Completed, syncing with `main`   |
| Fonts(otf) | Not planned                      |
| Viewports  | Completed, syncing with `docking`|
| Windows    | WIP                              |
| Docking    | Maybe soon                       |
| Widgets    | WIP                              |
| Backends   | Currently only have GMod backend |

Loading [FreeType](https://github.com/freetype/freetype) fonts and `Docking` might be too advanced for GMod/Games that enable Lua scripting. I don't think people need that. And they take a lot of time to re-write in Lua so anybody can resort to real binary modules!

### Notes

Roadmap and task list: [TODO](misc/TODO.md)

Things to pay attention to: [PORT](misc/PORT.md)

Please refer to official Dear ImGui docs or src code comments for documentation!

### How to Try it in GMOD?

1. Clone this project into your GMod `addons` folder
2. Create a singleplayer or multiplayer game
3. Run `imgui_test` command in engine console
4. You can also write your own test scripts and run them!

### My Development Platform

GMod: `x86-64 branch` with `LuaJIT 2.1.0-beta3`, `Lua 5.1`.

The core code(code except backend ones) in [lua/](lua) don't and shouldn't use anything that is exclusive in GMod Lua.

## Primary Goal

Implementing a Dear ImGui clone in **pure Lua**.
